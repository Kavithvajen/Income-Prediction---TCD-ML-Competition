# Income-Prediction---TCD-ML-Competition
Mandatory coursework submission for the module 'Machine Learning' during my M.Sc. Computer Science degree at Trinity College Dublin. The submission is for a competition that was held on Kaggle to predict the income when various other features were provided.

Some websites that aided/motivated me to try out the methods that I used are:
